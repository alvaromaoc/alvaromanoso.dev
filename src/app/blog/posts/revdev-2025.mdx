On Monday, March 31st, the annual Rev/Dev event took place at the Moritz factory in Barcelona, and I had the incredible opportunity to attend!

The Revolut team put a lot of care into organizing the event and were very attentive to all attendees.

We kicked things off with a warm welcome from *Svetlana Kochkina, Head of Employer Branding at Revolut*. She gave us a brief overview of the company‚Äôs history, highlighting key milestones and future goals.

Following Svetlana‚Äôs introduction, we enjoyed two insightful talks on how Revolut has tackled some of its most significant technical challenges:

## A tale of scaling an event-streaming platform

It was fascinating to learn about the challenges involved in managing the vast amount of event data generated by the Revolut ecosystem. C√©sar explained how his team scaled their database solutions to ensure high performance and reliability while handling billions of events‚Äîan ever-growing number.

## Lessons learned on building data aggregators: an engineering perspective

One thing I hadn‚Äôt fully grasped before (but had suspected) was just how complex and tricky it is to integrate a platform with multiple data providers across all the countries where Revolut operates. Xabier gave us a fantastic overview of how his team tackles this challenge‚Äîand, surprisingly, how fun it can be! Yes, fun! Each new provider is different, meaning there‚Äôs always something new to learn.

As the event drew to a close, Revolut had planned a generous and highly productive networking session. We had the chance to connect with fellow attendees while enjoying original Moritz beers and a selection of delicious snacks.
