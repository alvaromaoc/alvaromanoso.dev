Design patterns are very popular among software engineers. However, only a few of them prove truly useful when dealing with real-world projects and commonly used frameworks and libraries.

In this post, we will dive deep into the **Strategy Design Pattern** and explore how to leverage its functionality in real-world applications.

## What is the Strategy Design Pattern?
The **Strategy Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one in a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

The key characteristics of this design pattern are:
- **Avoids excessive use of if-else statements** by encapsulating different behaviors in separate classes.
- **Easily extendable** – to modify the existing code, you just need to add a new strategy.
- **Promotes the Open/Closed Principle**, making the code open for extension but closed for modification.

A common example used to illustrate this pattern is a _payment system_. Consider this scenario:

You are building a payment system where users can pay using different methods such as:
-   Credit Card
-   PayPal
-   Cryptocurrency

Each payment method has different processing logic. If you write all of them inside a single class, your code will become messy and difficult to maintain.

Instead of writing all payment logic in one place, you:

1. **Create an interface** (or abstract class) that defines a common method, e.g., <InlineCode>pay(double amount)</InlineCode>.
2. **Implement separate classes** for each payment method, each following that interface.
3. **Use each class interchangeably** depending on the use case.

<CodeBlock className="my-12"
           compact
           codeInstances={[
               {
                   code: `
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(double amount);
}
                   `,
                   label: 'Strategy Interface',
                   language: 'java'
               }
           ]}
           copyButton
/>

<CodeBlock className="my-12"
           compact
           codeInstances={[
               {
                   code: `
public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

public class CryptoPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using Cryptocurrency.");
    }
}
                        `,
                   label: 'Strategy Implementations',
                   language: 'java'
               }
           ]}
           copyButton
/>

That's cool! But in real applications, most of the time, we don't manually choose which strategy our code will use—we need this to be determined dynamically at runtime based on certain conditions.

## Using the Strategy Design Pattern in the Quarkus Framework
Now, let's see how we can leverage this design pattern in a Quarkus-based application, making our implementation capable of switching strategies dynamically at runtime.

Following the _payment system_ example, our application may need to execute each payment strategy based on certain conditions, such as a user's selection.

Imagine that the payment method is determined when an HTTP request is made to a REST endpoint. In that request, a parameter will likely indicate the desired payment method.

Here's an example of an HTTP request body being deserialized using the following record:
<CodeBlock className="my-12"
           compact
           codeInstances={[
               {
                   code: `
public record PaymentRequest(
    double amount,
    String paymentMethod
) {
}
                        `,
                   label: 'Payment Request',
                   language: 'java'
               }
           ]}
           copyButton
/>

We need a class capable of deciding which payment strategy to use based on the <InlineCode>paymentMethod</InlineCode> parameter. We will take advantage of Quarkus' dependency injection mechanism to build the following service.

First, we need to extend the <InlineCode>PaymentStrategy</InlineCode> interface by adding a method that allows us to identify each payment strategy by its name:

<CodeBlock className="my-12"
           compact
           codeInstances={[
               {
                   code: `
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    String name();
    void pay(double amount);
}
                        `,
                   label: 'Strategy Interface',
                   language: 'java'
               }
           ]}
           copyButton
/>

Each <InlineCode>PaymentStrategy</InlineCode> implementation must implement the <InlineCode>name</InlineCode> method, ensuring that the values are unique among all implementations.

<CodeBlock className="my-12"
           compact
           codeInstances={[
               {
                   code: `
public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void name() {
        return "Credit card";
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void name() {
        return "PayPal";
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

public class CryptoPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void name() {
        return "Crypto";
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using Cryptocurrency.");
    }
}
                        `,
                   label: 'Strategy Implementations',
                   language: 'java'
               }
           ]}
           copyButton
/>

Next, we inject all implementations into a <InlineCode>PaymentService</InlineCode> class, which will perform the payment based on the payment method specified in the <InlineCode>PaymentRequest</InlineCode>.

<CodeBlock className="my-12"
           compact
           codeInstances={[
               {
                   code: `
@ApplicationScoped
public class PaymentService {
    private final Map<String, PaymentStrategy> paymentStrategiesByName;

    public PaymentService(Instance<PaymentStrategy> paymentStrategies) {
        this.paymentStrategiesByName = paymentStrategies.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(PaymentStrategy::name, Function.identity()));
    }

    public void pay(PaymentRequest paymentRequest) {
        var paymentStrategy = Optional
            .ofNullable(paymentStrategiesByName.get(paymentRequest.paymentMethod()))
            .orElseThrow(() -> new UnknownPaymentMethodException("Unknown payment method: %s".formatted(paymentRequest.name())));

        paymentStrategy.pay(paymentRequest.amount());
    }
}
                        `,
                   label: 'Payment Service',
                   language: 'java'
               }
           ]}
           copyButton
/>

With this implementation, we have built an enhanced **Strategy Design Pattern** for real-world applications. This example was implemented using Quarkus, but the same approach could be applied in Spring Boot or Micronaut as well.
